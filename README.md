# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's Inside

This is a single-page portfolio site with four main sections:
- Home page with introduction
- Resume with my education and skills
- Projects I've worked on
- Contact form

## Features

- Works on desktop and mobile
- Smooth page transitions
- Sticky navigation bar
- Interactive education toggle (college/high school)
- Contact form with validation
- Mobile hamburger menu

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)

## How to Use

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. That's it!

If you want to run it on a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8000`

## Customizing It

Want to make this your own? Here's what to change:

1. Update your name, email, and phone number in the HTML
2. Replace the profile image (look for the `<img>` tag with class `profile-image`)
3. Edit the About Me section
4. Add your own education details
5. Update the skills list
6. Add your real projects
7. Change colors if you want (they're in the CSS `<style>` section)

## Color Scheme

- Blue gradient: #0b74ad to #1a1629
- Purple accent: #4023fc
- Light purple: #667eea

## Notes

The contact form shows an alert right now. To make it actually send emails, you'll need to connect it to a backend or use a service like Formspree or EmailJS.
